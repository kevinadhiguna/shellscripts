# Concepts:
# - If you are in an interactive shell (like Bash), it will typically print the name of the shell you are using (e.g., bash, sh, zsh, etc.).
# - If you are in a script, it will print the name of the script file.

echo $0

# Output:
# - In an interactive Bash session, echo $0 might output bash.
# - If you have a script named myscript.sh and you run ./myscript.sh, echo $0 within myscript.sh would output ./myscript.sh.
